Cuneiform Translation System

This project involves the design and implementation of a system to translate ancient Persian cuneiform text into modern Persian using image processing and machine learning. The system comprises two major components: a neural network for classifying cuneiform letters and a Streamlit-based application for user interaction.


Overview

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision techniques to create an automated tool for recognizing and translating cuneiform characters.

Components

Training System: A neural network model trained to classify cuneiform characters.

Application: A Streamlit-based application that preprocesses input images, performs character recognition, and displays results.
