# Cuneiform Translation System
This project involves the design and implementation of a system to translate ancient Persian cuneiform text into modern Persian using image processing and machine learning. The system comprises two major components: a neural network for classifying cuneiform letters and a Streamlit-based application for user interaction.

## Overview

### Objective
Cuneiform script is an ancient writing method used for languages such as Old Persian, Sumerian, and Babylonian. The script consists of 37 characters and is associated with inscriptions from the Achaemenid period. Due to the limited number of experts in ancient languages and the historical importance of these writings, this research focuses on automating the reading and translation of ancient texts.

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision techniques to create an automated tool for recognizing and translating cuneiform characters.
## Components

- 1. Training System: A neural network model trained to classify cuneiform characters.

- 2. Application: A Streamlit-based application that preprocesses input images, performs character recognition, and displays results.


## Methods: 
 - Collected and preprocessed a dataset of ancient Persian cuneiform characters from historical inscriptions using image processing tools like OpenCV for noise reduction and thresholding.

- extracted character images from inscriptions using template matching algorithms to locate and segment symbols from the background accurately.

- Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, scaling, translation) using OpenCV to increase dataset size and improve model generalization.

- Generated synthetic data with Autoencoders to create variations of existing characters, enhancing the dataset and mitigating class imbalance.

- Designed and implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify cuneiform characters, optimizing architecture for image recognition tasks.

- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and loss curves to refine models and identify areas for improvement.

- Developed a complete translation pipeline that integrated character detection and classification to convert ancient Persian cuneiform into modern Persian text.


## Training the Neural Network

### Dataset

Source: The dataset consists of cuneiform characters organized into training, testing, and validation sets. The dataset was initially built using template matching to identify and extract characters from scanned images of ancient cuneiform texts.

Data Augmentation: Additional data was generated by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing samples, increasing the diversity and size of the dataset.

- Number of Classes: 37 unique cuneiform characters.

- Input Shape: (30, 30, 1) grayscale images.


### Model Architecture

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and consists of:

#### Convolutional Layers:

- Conv2D: Two layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.

- MaxPooling2D: A pooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions.

- Dropout: Regularization to prevent overfitting.

- Fully Connected Layers:

#### Dense: 128 neurons with ReLU activation.

- Output layer with 37 neurons and softmax activation.

### Training Process

- Data Augmentation: Applied using ImageDataGenerator to enhance training diversity by including randomly transformed versions of the existing samples.

- Optimizer: Adam optimizer for gradient-based learning.

- Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy.

#### Training Parameters:

- Batch Size: 128

- Epochs: 100

## Application Details

### Streamlit Application

The application allows users to upload images and view the results of the cuneiform translation.

#### Features:

- Image Upload: Accepts images in jpg, jpeg, and png formats.

- Image Preprocessing: Converts images to a format compatible with the neural network.

- Processes images using a class (CuneiformProcessor) that loads the trained model.

#### Prediction:
- Predicts cuneiform characters and maps them to modern Persian equivalents.

- visualization: Displays both the uploaded and processed images in the app interface.

#### Preprocessing:
The CuneiformProcessor class includes:

- Model Loading: Loads the trained TensorFlow model.

- Character Mapping: Maps predicted indices to Persian letters using a predefined dictionary.
